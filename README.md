# Python-Blood-Bank-System
Blood Bank is a CLI application that has been developed to manage and streamline the operations of a blood bank system. This system offers a wide range of features. To access the system, users must first log in with valid credentials. If the user is an administrator, they must provide a username and password. But users cannot register as admin. Administrators have access to a variety of functions, including adding and viewing donors, search and sorting donors, edit and delete donor information, and viewing all transactions. However, if the user is new to the system, they must first register as a user. Once logged in, users will be directed to their dashboard, where all information is stored in a text file that serves as the database. Moreover, users can view all donors, search and sort donors, purchase blood, export transactions, and log out.
